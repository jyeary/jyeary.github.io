The article [The Fading U.S. Nuclear
Deterrent](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fading-u-s-nuclear-deterrent-1436739871)
in the Wall Street Journal by VADM Monroe should be an eye opener and
another wake-up call for the U.S policy makers. Admiral Monroe is in a
expert position to comment on the aging U.S. nuclear arsenal and forces.
Considering the long lead time for the upgrade of these forces, the time
is now to act. Our political and military leadership need to take the
steps necessary to begin the modernization process of our nuclear
forces.

Russia has recently made it known that they are proceeding with an
upgrade of their forces. China, Pakistan, India, North Korea are making
advances in their arsenals. North Korea is particularly troubling since
they are so unstable. They may not be able to hit Washington, but a
strike against California would be devastating. 

I am not a fan of a number of President Obama's policies, but the freeze
on the DoE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) R\&D must
released. It was an critical failure on the part of the administration
of Mr. Obama to allow our nuclear forces to degrade.

This time in history like many that have preceded it has shown that the
good intentions of nations can not be relied on. "The war to end all
wars" ended in 1918, and only 21 years later began WW II. The United
Nations was founded in 1945 to promote peace and unity among member
nations. This was followed by the Cold War that lasted until 1991. This
is not the time to turn our warheads into fuel rods. This is the time to
ensure that we can negotiate with our potential adversaries on high
ground.

Contact your elected representatives and let them know you want them to
support our military forces with modern equipment, and programs.

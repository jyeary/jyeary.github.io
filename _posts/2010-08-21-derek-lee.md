Yesterday, Chicago Cubs Fans paid respect to Derek Lee. He received a standing ovation for his seven years of service with the Cubs. It is a fine tribute to a great player, and a member of the Chicago sports family. You will be missed Derek!

On another note, I am so glad that he went 0/4 on the day at Wrigley. It is too bad that we could not close the game and ultimately lost. I am still a CUB fan at the end of the day...and...well...Derek you are a Brave now.

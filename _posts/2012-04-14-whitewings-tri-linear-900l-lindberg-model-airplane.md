I had the opportunity to build this really easy to assemble Whitewings Tri-Linear 900L Lindberg model airplane. It is a thick paper airplane. It flies like a dream. You can either fly it via hand toss, or use a sling shot. If you are looking for an airplane to build in the morning, and fly all afternoon, this is it.

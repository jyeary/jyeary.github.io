I read the novel First Men in the Moon by H.G. Wells this weekend. It is really neat to read a novel of such fantastic proportions. The novel was written well before our first trip to the moon, and contains a lot of scientific conjecture from the 1890s and early 1900s.

It is a fantastic tale of scientific discovery "Cavorite", a substance that is the antithesis of Gravity, and adventure; a trip to the moon. It details a fantastic land on the moon which we know does not exist. However, the science fiction portion of the adventure could easily be replaced with some other remote outpost in our solar system.

If you have not read it, it is a quick and exciting read. I don't want to give away details of the novel suffice to say it was a fun novel.

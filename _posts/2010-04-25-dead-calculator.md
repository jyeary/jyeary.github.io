I was really bummed. I thought that the batteries in my TI-85 calculator were finally dying so I bought new ones yesterday. Well it turns out that the screen is dying a quick pixel death. I have had it since college. I bought it in 1992, and it will finally be retired when my new calculator arrives.

So I spent a couple of hours researching calculators this afternoon. I finally decided to purchase an HP 50g graphing calculator.

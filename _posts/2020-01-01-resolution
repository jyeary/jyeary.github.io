# Do Achievable Things!

Every year most people make resolutions to do things like lose weight, eat more at home, travel, etc. After
some period of time most of those resolutions follow the way of the dinosaur. This year my New Year's resolution
is to "Do Achievable Things". This phrase is meant to act as a reminder to make decisions to do things that you can feel
a sense of success. Pick small tasks like walk daily, or run a mile. These small acts add up over time and builds upon success after success.

This last year I lost 30 lbs. I was running everyday, and switched over to a training plan to run a half-marathon this month. Unfortunately, I got a really bad
cold with bronchitis which totally derailed my running and training. The goal was reachable, but forces outside my control are going to make this goal unreachable
this month. Once I am back to being healthy, I will achieve this goal.

One of the goals I have is to migrate my blog from Wordpress over to Github, and to write more frequently. Let's see how that works out by the end of 2020.

Happy New Year 2020.

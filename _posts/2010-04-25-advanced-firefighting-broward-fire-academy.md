I completed my Basic/Advanced Firefighting STCW-95 required training at [Maritime Professional Training](http://www.mptusa.com/) two weeks ago. It was a really great class. The practical sessions were held for two days at the [Broward Fire Academy](http://www.broward.k12.fl.us/bfa//) in Davie, Fl (Fort Lauderdale). The class was a lot of fun.  
  
I got to put out a propane cylinder fire. When I was finished, my helmet was smoking it was so hot. I can not imagine how hot it would have been without two high-velocity fog nozzles on it.  
  
If you need to take advanced firefighting, I would recommend taking it at [Maritime Professional Training](http://www.mptusa.com/). The staff was South Florida firefighters with years of experience, and the facilities were crazy, scary, exciting, and fun.

I have been reading The Upanisads. They are spiritual commentaries from Hinduism. They are very interesting and in many ways like more like Christian proverbs. I was reading a set of verses in the book titled above. I came across some interesting remarks around yoga instruction. The first is an instruction of where to practice yoga.

>Â In a level, clean place, free from gravel, fire and sand,
> With soundless water, a dwelling and so on,
> Pleasing to the mind, and not harsh on the eye,
> Secret and sheltered from the wind, one should
> practice yoga.


This second passage makes reference, I believe, to the Ashtanga methods of yoga. Ashtanga is a form of fire (hot) yoga. It also hints at the benefits of the practice of yoga. A healthy body lends itself to a healthy mind without age.

> When earth, water, fire, air, and space have arisen
> And the fivefold strand of yoga has come forth,
> One has neither disease nor old age nor death,
> Having won a body made of the fire of yoga.

The third passage refers to some tangible benefits of yoga. A freedom from disease. This is accomplished from a healthy body. Steadiness which comes from practice of the asanas. Clarity of complexion is a result of a healthy body which has vanquished its impurities. A sweet voice (kind and understanding) comes from the self which having attained a meditative state is calming and soothing. The soothing voice turns a sea of chaos to reflective calm.

> Lightness, freedom from disease, steadiness,
> Clarity of complexion, sweetness of voice,
> A pleasant smell, little urine or excrement
> Tell of the first arisings of yoga.

The last section on little urine and excrement perhaps need a little more reflection. I can say from my practice of Ashtanga that I have found that I have left many a puddle of sweat from the burning fire of the asanas. This cleansing of the impurities through sweat, for me, has left me with little urine. The result has been a greater "thirst". I have also found that my practice has left me with less excrement as well. I think that the body processes food more effectively by practicing the asanas.

I read the op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal by Lindsey Graham,
Joesph Lieberman, and John McCain today called [Only Decisive Force Can
Prevail in
Afghanistan](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574404753110979442.html "Wall Street Journal Article - Only Decisive Force Can Prevail in Afghanistan").
I respect Messrs. Graham and McCain for their service to this great
country, but on this opinion piece I am not sure I can agree completely.

As military officers they understand the requirements of a successful
military engagement, but in country building they are far less experts.
There has been a ratcheting up of rhetoric around pushing more troops
there, but to what avail. Even if we crush the current Taliban forces,
the rear guard can be repopulated from the poor and starving masses. A
military push can not be successful unless it also brings a significant
civilian component along. 

Idle hands and minds in the hinterland form
the foundation of the Taliban. Unless we can find a better solutions to
the idleness and abject poverty, we will continue to engage the same
enemy in perpetuity. We need a cadre of well trained people to engage
the local population. This includes experts on farming, and animal
husbandry. It is harder to convince someone to die when they have hope
for a better future. 

**How can you help?** 

Tell your Congressman you
want humanitarian assistance to accompany those troops.  You can also
help with providing micro-loans to young entrepreneurs in Afghanistan
with  programs like
[Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/ "Kiva - Loans that change lives.") and
[Grameen
Foundation](http://www.grameenfoundation.org/ "Grameen Foundation")

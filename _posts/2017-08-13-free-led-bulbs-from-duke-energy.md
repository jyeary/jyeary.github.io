I received an 8-pack of "Simply Conserve 9W / 60W LED Warm White (2700K) Light Bulbs"Â yesterday from Duke Energy. Today, I installed all of them, and moved some CFL bulbs around to less used lights in the house. The goal will be to use all LED lights in the house. This is a good start.

I had an opportunity to send remarks to Duke Energy and take a survey on their program. I am very pleased to see that Duke Energy is trying to help customers become more energy efficient. It helps lower their costs, our costs, and more importantly drives us towards a greener future.

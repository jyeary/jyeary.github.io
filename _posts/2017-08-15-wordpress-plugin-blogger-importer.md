I can't say enough about how impressed I am with the [Blogger Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blogger-importer/) plugin from WordPress. If you are trying to convince someone to move from one blogging platform to another, you need to provide awesome migration tools. This tool worked amazingly. **I didn't have one glitch.** It worked on the first try, and it worked multiple times on the first try (I tried a number of cloud platforms, and deployments).

This tool convinced me that migrating from Blogger to Wordpress was not only possible, but could be made very simply. This is a great example of making a great first impression on a would-be customer. I was sold.

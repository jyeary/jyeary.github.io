I just read an article on [UI design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design) in SD Times. The article is a good reminder of what you should do with a UI. However, the article itself was an "eye sore". The combination of the images, logos, and colors did not follow the UI guidelines themselves. It is actually funny to read an article about UI design, and think "Wow this article layout sucks!".

The [online article](http://www.sdtimes.com/link/35621) is much nicer than the magazine.

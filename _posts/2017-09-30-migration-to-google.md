Well the task is done. I tried a number of Wordpress blogging solutions as turnkey alternatives to the deployment on Openshift 2. The most promising seemed like it would be Bitnami's Wordpress offering. I was wrong. I encountered nothing but permissions issues trying to get it to work. I finally settled on the Official Wordpress image on Google to run asÂ  a VM on Google Compute Engine.

You are witnessing the fruit of my migration from Openshift 2 to Google.

Once again, I have run into a message from Twitter again this morning. It seems more frequent in the last few months. I remember it being particularly bad around the [FIFA](http://www.fifa.com/) 2010 World Cup. Do they need more infrastructure? Is the [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) not scaling? They may force me to use [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca/) for more posts. I like Twitter, and hope they can figure out their scaling issues.

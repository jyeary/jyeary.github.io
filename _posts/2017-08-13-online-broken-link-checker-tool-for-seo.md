The process of migrating my personal blog from [Blogger](https://blogger.com) to a [WordPress](https://wordpress.com) platform using OpenShift 2 to power it has been an amazing learning process. One of the biggest SEO issues facing any blogger is broken links. The greater the number of posts, the greater the chances.

I have found that broken links fall into a couple of categories for me:

* Site no longer exists.
* Site was upgraded with no effort to protect permlinks.
* Articles, images, etc have been removed over time (archived)

This requires a blogger to update his posts to make sure that they are relevant in the future. I found an online tool called [Free Broken Link Checker](http://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/)1 that was instrumental in me updating this blog and my other [Java Evangelist John Yeary](http://javaevangelist.blogspot.com)2 to keep my visitors happy.

I am happy to say that as of today that I have no broken links. This does not mean that it won't happen in the future for the reasons noted above, but it is a good start.

I just read an article in [CIO Magazine](http://www.cio.com/) in the section called finish. The article is called "Don't Blow Your Top". The short article details some of the work being done by [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/) and [ConEd](http://www.coned.com/) to detect potential issues in the underground utility spaces like the build-up of explosive gasses.

The article reminded me of the real dangers with these underground utilities. The issues like fires, and explosions usually do not make the news, but are real dangers. I remember as a kid that they were tearing down an old utility station in [Chicago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago). I was walking past with some friends, and we witnessed first hand what an underground utility [explosion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosion) was like. Fortunately, the explosion was a [manhole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhole) "popper", but did not do any visible (surface) damage. It was smoking, and smoldering so we ran away.

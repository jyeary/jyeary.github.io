### Pow Wow Song
#### (Tune: My Bonnie)
> Cub Leaders sailed under the ocean,  
> One Pow Wow with all of the group.   
>
> We learned how to read our compass  
> Play games, sing songs as a group.   
>  
> (chorus)  
> We’re back, We’re back We’re back from under the sea.  
> We’re back, We’re back  
> Yes, We’re back from under the sea.   
>  
> We’ve sailed ‘til we’ve reached all our sessions  
> We’ve landed with no body hurt.  
> We went to our Blue and Gold banquet.  
> Should have been in a Blue, Gold grass skirt.   
>  
> (chorus)   
> We’re heading back home this fine evening  
> After having fun all of the day.  
> The last thing the staff will hear  
> Is “**THANKS FOR A GREAT POW WOW DAY**”.   
> (chorus)

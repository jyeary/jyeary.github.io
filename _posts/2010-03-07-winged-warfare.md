I finished the autobiographical book by Lt. Col. William Bishop. As I noted in my last blog post, this is a great read for anyone who is a history buff, or an air warfare aficionado. It is interesting that some of the same air warfare rules of WW I are still applicable today.

I am almost positive that if we took a WW I ace and had them fight a modern warplane, they would put the modern fighter pilot at a disadvantage (A gun to gun fight... no missiles). The WW I had to use more personal aerial skill than a modern pilot who has everything controlled electronically.

The book was great, and I hope that others who read it come to the same conclusion.

I am designing a complementary [color scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme) for my website, and blogs. I have a logo from a designer which is very nice, but I needed a [color palette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_%28computing%29). I found a really cool color matcher based on an image that you upload.

The site that I found is on [DeGraeve.com](http://www.degraeve.com/) and the application is called [Color Palette Generator](http://www.degraeve.com/color-palette/index.php). It created a nice color palette for me as you can see below.

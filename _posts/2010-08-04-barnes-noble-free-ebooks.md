[Barnes & Noble](http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/) is offering [Free eBooks](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/Free-eBooks/379001668/?cds2Pid=29168&linkid=1608371). This seems on the surface to be a good deal until you try to get one. Appearances are deceiving. Then they want you to register a credit card to get it. This is marketing at its best. Well I am not going to register a credit card to get a "free" book. That is ridiculous. I wonder how many people will fall for their bait & switch tactics.

The WWW needs to be on the lookout for my youngest son. He is trying his hand at blogging. [The Polar Bear Boy](http://thepolarbearboy.blogspot.com/) is on the loose.

He is a huge fan of video games so expect some great content if you are into Destiny and Fallout 4.

He is also a master Minecrafter.

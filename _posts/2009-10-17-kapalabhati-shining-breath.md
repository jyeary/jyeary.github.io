A technique for performing Kapalabhati. This is an energizing and cleansing breath like Bhastrika.  


  1. Sit upright and forcibly expel all the air from the lungs. The primary movement is accomplished by using the diaphragm.
  2. Allow the lungs to fill passively.
  3. Repeat 10 times in 3-4 cycles with periods of normal breathing between sets.  

This is another energizing, invigorating, and cleansing pranayama technique.  
  
**Uses:**  


  1. In the morning to start the body and mind.
  2. During the day when feeling lethargic, or sleepy.  

**Constraints:**  
  
Do not perform before bedtime. It may prevent falling asleep.

title: Anuloma Viloma - Alternate Nostril Breathing (Sivananda Style)

A variation of the alternate nostril breathing technique. This pranayama technique has a quieting effect, and reduces mental turbulence. The ultimate effect of this technique is to quietly reduce the mind to becoming a witness to the process, and make the breathing effortless.

**Note:** Make sure that the nasal passages are clear before beginning. Using a neti pot to clean the sinuses is a method to ensure that the nasal passages are cleansed.
  1. Close the right nostril. Exhale through the left, and inhale on a count of 4. 	
  2. Close off both nostrils, and retain the breath for a count of 16.
  3. Keep the left nostril closed, and exhale through the right nostril for a count of 8.
  4. Keep the left nostril closed, and inhale through the right nostril for a count of 4.
  5. Close both nostrils for a count of 16.
  6. Release the left nostril and exhale for a count of 8. This completes one cycle.
  7. Repeat the process for a set of 10 cycles.


This technique has a relaxing effect on the mind and body.

**Uses:**
  1. Use prior to performing mantra meditation to calm the mind.
  2. Anytime your mind is racing.
  3. When you need to fall asleep.
  
**Constraints:**

Do not perform if you need to be alert.

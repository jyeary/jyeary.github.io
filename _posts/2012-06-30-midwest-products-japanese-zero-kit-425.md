Last weekend I built the [Midwest Products](http://www.midwestproducts.com/) Japanese Zero model. It took a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon to make. It is a nice balsa and tissue paper model powered by a rubber-band. The model was fun to build and fly.  
  
If you like model airplanes, look for this classic on Ebay. It is kit #425.

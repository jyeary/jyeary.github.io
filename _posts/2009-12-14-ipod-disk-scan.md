I was looking through some old notes on my computer and found these notes on how to scan the disk on your iPod (1st and 2nd generation).  
  
The iPod has the ability to scan its hard drive for errors and repair some of those errors. If you suspect your iPod's drive has issues, try scanning the disk.  
1. Make sure the iPod is plugged, or is charged.  
2. To do so, reset the iPod, and when you see the Apple logo, press and hold the Previous, Next, Select, and Menu buttons.

**Note:** An animated icon of a disc will appear along with a progress bar.  
  
This test can take a long period of time (15-30 minutes).

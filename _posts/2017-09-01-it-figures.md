Well I got a nice surprise from OpenShift a couple of days ago. The
OpenShift 2 is end of life, and will be shut down at the end of
September. I migrated over to OpenShift from Blogger only to have it
pulled out from under me. They provide a means to migrate to OpenShift
3, but it has a "Resource Hibernation" periods as noted below.

The resource hibernation is not really a good fit for anyone using it
for blogging, or much of anything unless it is just pure testing. This
weekend I will need to see about migrating again, but this time perhaps
to Google Cloud.

This advertisement caused a lot of controversy about the apparent distastefulness of the photo. **I strongly disagree!** The image is a great example of the hard work that it takes to make a ballet performance seem effortless.

Anything worth doing requires hard work and perseverance.  I love this image. I think it serves to show people the true cost of perfection.

There are few things that I must say are quite entertaining about living
in South Carolina. I went into a restaurant/general store in
[Pumpkintown,
SC](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Pumpkintown,+SC&hl=en&ll=35.002898,-82.653065&spn=0.033044,0.066047&sll=35.047681,-82.624001&sspn=0.002075,0.004128&z=15).
Yes "Pumpkintown"\! The general store called [Pumpkintown
Mountain](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.048048,-82.62418&ll=35.047681,-82.624001&spn=0.002075,0.004128&sll=35.00278,-82.65306&sspn=0.018281,0.032015&num=1&t=h&z=19&iwloc=lyrftr:h,11835591884208069584,35.047754,-82.623799)
at the Pumpkintown Opera. They have an unusual assortment of foods
including Moonshine Jelly. I could not pass on such an opportunity to
try such a treat.

I don't know what I was expecting. I thought it might taste like alcohol, or have a sharp taste. Actually, it has a sweet taste with a pleasant "moonshine" taste. I would recommend trying some if you get a chance. You will not be disappointed, and may even feel like you are getting away with something from them "Revenue agents".

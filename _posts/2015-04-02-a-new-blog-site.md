title: A new Blogging Platform with Github Pages
---

I am looking at exporting my pages from Blogger to a platform where I can have more control over the layout. If this _endeavor_
works, I will look at moving my crown jewel from Blogger too.

I want to explore how difficult it is to get this setup and working effectively.

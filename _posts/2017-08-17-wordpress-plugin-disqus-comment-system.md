One of the biggest challenges with blogging is the management of comments. The readers may show appreciation, or challenge your post. In both cases, you want to be able to publish the comments with as little moderation as possible. The problem we face in the Internet Society are trolls. Yes, you have all seen them, they post anonymously, post vulgar remarks, or try to bait you into a public discussion of their negative commentary. So how do you manage it?

TheÂ [Disqus Comment System](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/) plugin allows you to use the Disqus system to manage your comments. This should help you get rid of the trolls and allow wholesome commentary discuss to flourish.

**Let good good commentary rise to the top!**

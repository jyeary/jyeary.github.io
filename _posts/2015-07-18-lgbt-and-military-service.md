I understand that there has been a change in DoD policy to allow current transgender soldiers and sailors to remain in the service without fear of being discharged. We have come a great distance from my days as a sailor in the 1980s and 1990s.  
  
I was once opposed to the service of homosexuals in the military. This was more pronounced before I served with the best military in the world. There were individuals whom I served with who were gay, or lesbian. We all knew who they were, but they remained silent. The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy became the rule under which we operated.  
  
I have no issue with a person's personal sexual choices. After serving with men and women of all stripes, I came to understand that if you can do the job and you have my six, I don't care what you do on your time. I had an AO2 lesbian female on my weapons loading team who was worth more than 4 of the men I had on the team. I couldn't have been more proud of her service, and dedication. I am glad she was part of my team, and I hope she would allow me the same honors.  
  
My acceptance of LGBT soldiers and sailors should be taken with a grain of salt. I don't believe that the US military should be in a position to pay for gender reassignment, or other therapies like hormones. Those are personal issues, and do not need to be paid for by taxpayers.  
  
I also don't believe that our Chaplain Corps should be faced with acceptance of LGBT members if this is in opposition to their religious beliefs. In other words, don't force a Christian Chaplain to perform a gay wedding if he is opposed on religious grounds.  
  
Honor. Courage. Commitment.

A technique for performing Nadi Shodhana, or alternate nostril breathing. This pranayama technique has a quieting effect, and reduces mental turbulence. The ultimate effect of this technique is to quietly reduce the mind to becoming a witness to the process, and make the breathing effortless.  
  
**Note:** Make sure that the nasal passages are clear before beginning. Using a neti pot to clean the sinuses is a method to ensure that the nasal passages are cleansed.  
  1. Use the right hand for this technique. Place the thumb over the right nostril, while your third and fourth fingers are over the left.
  2. Inhale and exhale through one nostril and alternate between nostrils on each inhalation.
  3. **(Alternate)** Inhale in one nostril, close it off and exhale through the other. Repeat the process alternating back and forth.  

**(Alternate)**  
  1. Inhale through one nostril on a count of 4.
  2. Close off both nostrils for a count of 16.
  3. Exhale through the opposite nostril for a count of 8.
  4. Close both nostrils for a count of 16.
  5. Inhale through the opposite nostril.
  6. Repeat the process for a set of 10 rounds  

This technique has a relaxing effect on the mind and body.   
  
**Uses:**  
  1. Use prior to performing mantra meditation to calm the mind.
  2. Anytime your mind is racing.
  3. When you need to fall asleep.  

**Constraints:**  
  
Do not perform if you need to be alert.

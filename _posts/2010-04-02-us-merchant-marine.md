I am in the process of renewing my USCG 3rd Assistant Engineer - Unlimited license. The process is complex to say the least. I have been told a number of times already that I should not have let it expire. Since I let it expire, the process of getting a new one is much more complex.  
  
I am going to do a series of blog posts on how to become a US Merchant Marine Engineering Officer once your license expires. This applies in general to anyone who wants to join the Merchant Marine.  
  
I have decided to also work on my MCA (Maritime Coastguard Agency - UK) and RYA (Royal Yachting Association) credentials as well.  
  
My ultimate goal is to renew my USCG engineering license, but I would also like to get my Masters license as well. For those who know me, I always want more. I want to be a Master Mariner who can operate on the bridge, or in the engine room.

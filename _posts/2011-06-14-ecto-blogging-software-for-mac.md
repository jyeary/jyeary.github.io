[Ecto](http://illuminex.com/ecto/) by Illuminex is [blogging software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_software) for the mac. It has a simple user interface and connects to almost any blogging software available. More details on Ecto can be found on their [website](http://illuminex.com/ecto/). This post was added using it. It was very easy to understand and use. I also added some additional information after publishing and it was just as easy.

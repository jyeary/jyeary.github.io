I am providing a list of really cool and easy to use frameworks to make your coding easier in Java. I will keep updating this as I move along. Here are a few to get you started.

### Frameworks

* [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - This framework makes it easier to create classes and focus on the important parts of the code. It removes a significant amount of plumbing and makes it easier to read your code.
* [JCommander](http://jcommander.org/) - The project quote says it all... **"Because life is too short to parse command line parameters"**. This is an alternative to using [Apache Commons CLI](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/) that is much easier to implement and use. It is annotation based.
* [vavr](http://www.vavr.io/) - A framework that assists in using Collections API in a more useful and functional way.
* [j2html](https://j2html.com/) - A **"Fast and fluent Java HTML5 builder"**. Very nicely implemented and easy to use.
* [JsonPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) - A Java DSL for reading JSON documents. This makes processing JSON documents easy. It can be used in conjunction with Gson and Jackson to do JSON-Object mapping.

Who made the famous Uzi? 

You guessed it Israeli Military Industries (IMI). The iconic Uzi and its symbol of Israeli innovation and power is being sold. The Israeli Government is trying to divest itself of state-owned businesses. Perhaps having its leash cut, or at least lengthened may allow it to innovate and experience a new age of growth. Elbit Systems, Renco, and SK Group are in the bidding. Personally, I would like to see Elbit Systems, Ltd. win the bid. This would keep IMI part of the heritage of Israel, and keep weapons development in Israel.

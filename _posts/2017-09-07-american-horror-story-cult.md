I know it is in its 7th season, but I watched the first episode of season 7 tonight on FX. I was not scared, but I will say that it was creepy if not predictable in a horrible way. I will tune in next week to watch the second episode in the series. I really don't want to give anything away.

I personally was satisfied to skip social media before watching it so I would be surprised. Yes, it was creepy and I dare say more scary that it almost seemed realistic.

I did not need to suspend disbelief to see this happening today. A sad commentary on society in general, but makes for a good series.

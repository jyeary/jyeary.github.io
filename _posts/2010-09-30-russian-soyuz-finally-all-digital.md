The [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/) Spectrum had a story about the final upgrades being done to the Russian [Soyuz spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_%28spacecraft%29) to make it finally all digital. Our standing as a space nation will take a major blow when the [Space Shuttle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle) fleet is placed in retirement. The Russian Soyuz (over 40 years old) will pick up the slack with more missions to keep the [International Space Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) manned.

These final upgrades on the Soyuz will hopefully keep it operational while the U.S. determines the next [launch vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle) to replace the Space Shuttle.

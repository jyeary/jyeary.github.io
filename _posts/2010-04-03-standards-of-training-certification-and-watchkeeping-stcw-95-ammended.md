I need to take a number of certification/training courses which are required of all merchant mariner's who sail in international waters. These standards were implemented by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which is part of the United Nations. The US is signatory to the agreement, and the USCG is charged with making sure that all mariner's are in compliance as required.  
  
In my case, I need to have Basic Survival Training (BST) which includes basic fire prevention and fire fighting, personal survival techniques, personal safety and social responsibility, and first aid. This covers STCW A-VI/1-1 to 1-4.  
  
I also needed Advanced Fire fighting (AFF) which covers STCW A-VI/3. This is a five day course generally which must be renewed every five years.  
  
The Proficiency in Survival Craft and Rescue Boats (PSC/R) (Lifeboatman) is required of all deck and engineering officers. This satisfies the STCW A-VI/2, Table A-VI/2-1, 2-2 requirements.  
  
I have been advised that I may need to take a Medical First Aid Provider course which will satisfy STCW A-VI/4, 4.1-4.3 and Table 4-1. I need to confirm this is indeed necessary. I understand this may be required to for a raise in grade from the support to the operational licenses as per USCG Policy Letter 01- 02.

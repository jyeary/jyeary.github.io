I am not opposed to civil unions, but I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. This is one of my core beliefs, and I don't think the legislature should be so shallow to disregard this generally accepted tenet. I want to encourage an open and accepting society, but this is unacceptable to me. I feel like it cheapens my own marriage.

I know this kind of remark will likely draw some lightening rod remarks, but my personal belief system is based on a Christian lifestyle. I am not one to condemn gay and lesbian lifestyles, but please don't throw acid in my face on marriage. Perhaps my views will change in the future, but marriage seems fairly entrenched. That said, I have evolved over time, and perhaps this will too. At the moment, I see it as a FAIL on the part of the NY and other legislatures around the country.

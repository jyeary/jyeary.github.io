I just read the Editor's Note from Jonathan Erickson from Dr. Dobbs. It was entitled
"Yet Another Reason to Stock Up on [Jolt Cola](http://www.joltenergy.com/)". It was a great article about the potential use of various [bio-fuels](http://www.wikinvest.com/industry/Biofuels) including... you guessed it JOLT cola. How awesome is that? Talk about all the fun you have with that as a quip. You already read the title of this post, so you can see where this leads.

On a serious note, it is fascinating that we could take a [high fructose corn syrup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-fructose_corn_syrup) laden miracle of modern chemistry, and turn it into a battery. You can give yourself and your computer with the same Jolt. I have visions of Back to the Future II with the [Mr. Fusion](http://bttf.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Fusion) attached to my computer.

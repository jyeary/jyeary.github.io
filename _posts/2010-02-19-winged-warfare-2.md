I flew for many years on P-3 Orion patrol planes for the US Navy. I had this dream of being like Lieutenant (Left-ten-ant) Colonel William A. Bishop. OK, I will humor you with who he is since it is currently the Olympic Games going on, and he is a Canadian hero.

Lt. Col. Bishop was an aerial ace (72 confirmed kills) during WW I. I am reading his autobiography right now. I knew who he was, but it is fascinating to read him in his own words.Â  At this point, I can say that the read is worth it, but I need to find a current publisher. It is a real cool story for anyone who is a history buff.

There is a book review to follow.

	     <h2 id="the-next-generation-of-developers">The Next Generation of Developers</h2>

<p>This is the 4th year I have taught the Programming Merit Badge to Boy Scouts in the Southbounder District of the Blue Ridge Council in Greenville, SC. I consider it quite an honor to be asked to do it for this many years. The Boy Scout program was instrumental in my development as a boy. This has been my way of paying it forward to the next generation. My oldest son is an Eagle Scout, and my youngest is well into his journey at this point.</p>

<p>I have been a Boy Scout Assistant Scout Master, Unit Commissioner, Roundtable Commissioner, Cub Master, and a Den Leader. The most fulfilling part of my Scouting experience as an adult was Cub Master. I still think I am a 9 year old boy at heart. If you have not considered working with kids whether in Scouting, or another youth program, give it a chance. You will feel rewarded and humbled by the experience. I think I have learned more from the scouts than I have taught them.</p>

<h2 id="programming-merit-badge">Programming Merit Badge</h2>

<p>There are key elements that must be completed, and these will change over time as the program evolves. They broadly include safety, history, general knowledge, and coding. A key element that must be completed for all the participants is the Boy Scout Cyber Chip. At the time of this writing, it must be renewed yearly, and covers different age groups.</p>

<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>

<p>This topic can be exciting if you can make a connection with the scouts on the topic. I am a gamer, so I am guilty of doing a lot of bad things with regards to ergomonics while playing games. When I relate my experiences, I get instant feedback of “Wow… me too!” Building that sense of espirit de corps with the scouts makes a tough topic interesting. They also become curious about what games I play. I also make mods for games which helps me to relate with them.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>We can’t talk about where we are without knowing where we have been. I enjoy this section, and the scouts and parents who are present seem to enjoy it as well. I think my side bars about various items like the story of Grace Hopper and computer bugs make them laugh. If you don’t know the story, do a quick search on Google.</p>

<h3 id="general-knowledge">General Knowledge</h3>

<p>I talk about the languages and usage with examples. The legal section on copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets (though really important) is one section that causes obvious glaze on their faces. Thankfully, I have a really cool career to get them talking: cryptanalyist.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>This is what the scouts are here to learn. I talk about some basics of how to code with tools like <code class="highlighter-rouge">notepad</code>, a terminal, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">javac</code>. I show them some of the pitfalls of this approach. It does not take a lot of effort to prove this point. Then I show them how to use the <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">Apache Netbeans IDE</a> to do development. If you are teaching programming, the clear choice is <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">Apache Netbeans IDE</a> for development. The hurdles to learning to use it are minimal. The scouts caught on quickly, and the few shortcut keys I taught them were used in earnest.</p>

<p>My goal was to teach them to code beyond the basic “Hello World!”. I have an example on how to calculate where <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> crosses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">x-axis</code> using the equation of a line: <script type="math/tex">y=mx+b</script></p>

	     <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>After a couple of years using Wordpress, I have found that constantly upgrading, broken plugins, managing a database, backups, and security certificates have brought me back to Github.</p>

<p>When I first started the blogging journey, I wanted a text editor which I could use to create my posts. Over the years, I have found myself using <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> at first for my Github projects, and finally for all of my work. This includes taking all my notes using Markdown.</p>

<p>I decided to come back and take a look at GitHub, and reconsider my previous position of it not being the right fit for me. Today, I think it is a perfect fit. The platform has been enhanced, and a number of great templates have been created to make using it a lot easier. That said, a number of the templates are <strong>not</strong> non-technical user friendly. I have had some challenges getting the blog back off the ground using Github, but I think that the final results will be worth it.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, I will begin the slow process of migrating the old blog pages over to Github, and adding new content. As I begin this journey, I will tell you how I did it.</p>

<h2 id="decisions">Decisions</h2>

<p>If you are not comfortable in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> then using Github pages are not for you. You have to decide if you want to learn it, and use it. Otherwise the risk is that you will <strong>not</strong> blog which is the opposite of your objective.</p>

<p>If you have a blog already, then you need to decide if you want to do the work to migrate it. This could be an enormous undertaking if you have been doing it for years. It also could be something that you may not want to do. I have another blog <a href="http://javaevangelist.blogspot.com/">Java Evangelist John Yeary</a> which is quite large. I wrote it on Blogger, and decided that I <strong>did not</strong> want to move it. It was established, and profitible. I did decide years ago that I wanted to move it from a propietary platform and make it more “my own”. Thus I created a blog simply called John Yeary. That is the blog we are going to be migrating.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps">First Steps</h2>

<p>The first step in getting started in creating, or migrating a blog is to find a good template to use. You can go all-in on creating your own using, but even <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> uses a basic template called <em>minima</em> when you create a simple site using the tutorial.</p>

<p>I chose a template based on the popular <a href="https://ghost.org/blog/">ghost</a> platform called <a href="https://github.com/jekyller/jasper">Jasper</a>. There is another version called <a href="https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2">Jasper 2</a>, but I found the original Jasper version more my style.</p>

<p>The nice thing about choosing to use an open source template is that you are free to modify it to match your needs. This was not insurmountable in Wordpress, but much more challenging. I was also in fear of the template being upgraded that would make me have to figure out what changed, and if anything was broken. Since we are using a source control system (git) and we can control our own destiny with regards to upgrades, then the worries about template changes from Wordpress are no longer an issue.</p>

<p>Next, I would make sure that you understand what the templates do and how they are configured. The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll Quickstart</a> is very good. It will give you a great foundation on how Jekyll generates the pages, and displays them.</p>

<p>In my case I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/jekyller/jasper">Jasper</a> for my templates. This template uses plugins to generate additional functionality on the pages, as a result it can not be used directly for generating my pages from Github. In this case, I am using <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a> to build the the pages and push the changes from a development branch to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch since this is the branch which is used to deploy the pages. In my case it is only merging the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> data.</p>

<h2 id="migrating-existing-pages">Migrating Existing Pages</h2>

<p>There are a number of mechanisms to import existing blog formats into Jekyll. They can be found on the <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll Import Documentation</a>. I am migrating from Wordpress so I tried a couple of different mechanisms. Although, it mentions the Wordpress.com importers for use with the online site, I found them to be useful on the self-hosted variety I was using. The best one after trying them all was <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">Exitwp</a>.</p>

<p>I found that not just one tool worked for me, and I am going to have to use multiple results and merge them to get the pages migrated.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I tried Apache Archiva in a Docker container this evening. I was hoping that it would be a good alternative to Nexus. Once I got it running in the container I realized that it really does not support all the features that I use in Nexus.</p>

<p>The container I used (I won’t bash the author) kept wanting to only publish on 0.0.0.0/8080 even though I was telling it to use the host IP address on 8080. After getting it up and running, I decided not to try and fix it though.</p>

<p>I wanted to play with it for a couple of hours, and I concluded that it would not work for me. There is a lot of promise though. I will come back and examine it at a later time.</p>

	     <p>I found Wordpress easier to use for my needs. The jekyll solution works for a lot of people, but I found that converting a Blogger blog to it was more difficult. If you are interested in my personal blog, please click on the links on the main page for my blogs.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Well the task is done. I tried a number of Wordpress blogging solutions as turnkey alternatives to the deployment on Openshift 2. The most promising seemed like it would be Bitnami’s Wordpress offering. I was wrong. I encountered nothing but permissions issues trying to get it to work. I finally settled on the Official Wordpress image on Google to run as  a VM on Google Compute Engine.</p>

<p>You are witnessing the fruit of my migration from Openshift 2 to Google.</p>

	     <p>Well I got a nice surprise from OpenShift a couple of days ago. The
OpenShift 2 is end of life, and will be shut down at the end of
September. I migrated over to OpenShift from Blogger only to have it
pulled out from under me. They provide a means to migrate to OpenShift
3, but it has a “Resource Hibernation” periods as noted below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your project resources sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity, and must
sleep 18 hours in a 72 hour period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resource hibernation is not really a good fit for anyone using it
for blogging, or much of anything unless it is just pure testing. This
weekend I will need to see about migrating again, but this time perhaps
to Google Cloud.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>This is my attempt to get Wordpress running on OpenShift 2 using 2 gears. I would like to migrate my personal blog for John Yeary from Blogger to another blogging platform so that I have more control of the
layout, and appearance. So I backed up the data from Blogger and used the import tool and it seems to have worked more amazingly than I could have imagined.</p>

<p>Connecting to the MySQL database on the gear requires a little more finesse since it is not exposed publicly. Great for security, but not so great for getting remote access. I used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rhc port-forward</code> command to accomplish the task.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rhc port-forward -a &lt;application-name&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the items that I see remaining:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>Perform the same operations on a test blog, and see if blogger will forward requests correctly.</del></li>
  <li><del>Check permlinks to ensure that they still work.</del></li>
  <li><del>Setup SSL.</del></li>
  <li><del>Move media from the gear to cloud storage.</del></li>
  <li><del>Backup and restore database.</del></li>
  <li><del>Install Wordpress on another platform and use a newer version of MySQL to see if there are any issues.</del></li>
  <li><del>Add Google Adsense to see if they work.</del></li>
  <li><del>Test Amazon Associate links.</del></li>
  <li><del>Update Amazon Associates links.</del></li>
  <li><del>Add SSO Login API for Disqus</del></li>
  <li><del>Fix broken links on posts.</del></li>
</ul>

<p>So far it has worked. The blog is running on a 2 gears with a load balancer. I have migrated the blog. I still need to Adsense, and update Amazon Associates links.</p>

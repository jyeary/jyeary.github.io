	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I read a very good article this morning on the growing censorship of the Internet and blogging in Asia. The article: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125288982580207609.html" title="Wall Street Journal Article - Web Censoring Widens Across Southeast Asia">Web Censoring Widens Across Southeast Asia</a> was published in the Wall Street Journal for Monday, 14 September 2009.</p>

<p>The article details a number of efforts by governments to systematically stymie opposition groups, political dissenters, or individual bloggers. I am alarmed that the government in Malaysia would invoke a colonial era Internal Security Act to detain individuals for two years without trial.</p>

<p>The government is trying to put on a friendly moderate face to encourage western companies, and investors to help develop their growing economy. The problem is that laws like the Internal Security Act undermine this moderate view of Malaysia.</p>

<p>The article indicates that 63% of people in Malaysia use the Internet. This is incredible and really provides an opportunity for the government to engage their people.</p>

<p>I am not trying to single out Malaysia by any means, but the closest county in Internet users in the article is Iran with 32%. I don’t see them making any changes to become more open soon.</p>

	     <p>I read the op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal by Lindsey Graham,
Joesph Lieberman, and John McCain today called <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574404753110979442.html" title="Wall Street Journal Article - Only Decisive Force Can Prevail in Afghanistan">Only Decisive Force Can
Prevail in
Afghanistan</a>.
I respect Messrs. Graham and McCain for their service to this great
country, but on this opinion piece I am not sure I can agree completely.</p>

<p>As military officers they understand the requirements of a successful
military engagement, but in country building they are far less experts.
There has been a ratcheting up of rhetoric around pushing more troops
there, but to what avail. Even if we crush the current Taliban forces,
the rear guard can be repopulated from the poor and starving masses. A
military push can not be successful unless it also brings a significant
civilian component along.</p>

<p>Idle hands and minds in the hinterland form
the foundation of the Taliban. Unless we can find a better solutions to
the idleness and abject poverty, we will continue to engage the same
enemy in perpetuity. We need a cadre of well trained people to engage
the local population. This includes experts on farming, and animal
husbandry. It is harder to convince someone to die when they have hope
for a better future.</p>

<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>

<p>Tell your Congressman you
want humanitarian assistance to accompany those troops.  You can also
help with providing micro-loans to young entrepreneurs in Afghanistan
with  programs like
<a href="http://www.kiva.org/" title="Kiva - Loans that change lives.">Kiva</a> and
<a href="http://www.grameenfoundation.org/" title="Grameen Foundation">Grameen
Foundation</a></p>

	  <title>U.K. National ID Card and Real ID</title>

	     <p>IBM and CSC were awarded the contract by the U.K. Identity and Passport Service for creating biometric enhanced IDs. The goal is to provide a safe and secure ID which contains built in verification of identity.</p>

<p>Biometric enhanced IDs are the future. This could take the form of finger printing, retinal scans, or perhaps DNA.</p>

<p>There are a number of people especially in the U.S. who are opposed to a national ID card. The fear of Big Brother is even more overwhelming than in Britain where 1984 was a predicted future.</p>

<p>The national ID card, if combined with other identification, could simplify the lives of Americans. Imagine having an ID which was also your driver’s license. Perhaps we could include Social Security in an enhanced secure form. I can envision insurance information, medical records, banking, and credit cards.</p>

	     <p>The Wall Street Journal published a front page article on 8 April 2009 entitled <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123914805204099085.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Electricity Grid in U.S. Penetrated By Spies</a> It is a chilling report on the weakness of our national electrical infrastructure. They point out that the utilities failed to detect the breaches, and that they were informed by the CIA of the breaches. Good for our intelligence agencies, but poor marks for the commercial enterprises which should be more vested in security. The report generalizes the potential threat from countries like Russia, and China. The threats exist from those nations, but I offer a more chilling thought.</p>

<p>Terrorists, rogue nations (North Korea and Iran), and cyber criminals pose a greater risk. Terrorists would love to black out a city and ravage it in the confusion. Shutting down the subways (electrical) in New York, or Chicago and releasing poison gas would be devastating.</p>

<p>Rogue nations like Iran and N. Korea do not have vested interests in the U.S. like Russia and particularly China. They have nothing to lose from disrupting our infrastructure. The Chinese have no interest per se in causing any financial disruptions since they are one of the largest U.S. Treasury debt holders. North Korea can not be said to have the same restraint.</p>

<p>Cyber criminals already cause major disruptions. Holding the utilities hostage would be one more item to add to their lists.</p>

<p>I don’t want to sound the alarm of doom. There is hope. Detection of the breaches by the CIA should be the siren’s call to take some action.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Redundant control systems should be put in place on separate secured networks. The Internet was designed by DARPA to weather a nuclear attack. This same idea combined with the available dark fiber could serve as a backbone for a national monitoring grid.</li>
  <li>Every utility should be a part of a national utility grid which flows through a secured national monitoring system.</li>
  <li>The government should look at requiring that the utilities spend more than 2% of their revenue on R&amp;D. An article in <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/17-04/gp_intro">Wired</a> points out that only 700 miles of infrastructure have been added since 2000. Perhaps we should require that utilities spend at least 10% on infrastructure and 2% on security.</li>
  <li>Breach information should be passed through a security information clearinghouse similar to <a href="http://www.cert.org/">CERT</a>.</li>
  <li>The utilities should consider focusing on free open source software (FOSS) and collaborative development of technologies which can be shared. Common software would allow the groups to focus on more reliable and secure systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every year most people make resolutions to do things like lose weight, eat more at home, travel, etc. After
some period of time most of those resolutions follow the way of the dinosaur. This year my New Year’s resolution
is to <strong>Do Achievable Things</strong>. This phrase is meant to act as a reminder to make decisions to do things that you can feel
a sense of success. Pick small tasks like walk daily, or run a mile. These small acts add up over time and builds upon success after success.</p>

<p>This last year I lost 30 lbs. I was running everyday, and switched over to a training plan to run a half-marathon this month. Unfortunately, I got a really bad
cold with bronchitis which totally derailed my running and training. The goal was reachable, but forces outside my control are going to make this goal unreachable
this month. Once I am back to being healthy, I will achieve this goal.</p>

<p>One of the goals I have is to migrate my blog from Wordpress over to Github, and to write more frequently. Let’s see how that works out by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>Happy New Year 2020.</p>

caught a fly. The fly is sticking out of its mouth.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I read a really great <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123958260423012269.html">op ed</a> in The Wall Street Journal from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Fleischer">Ari Fleischer</a> today. The piece is entitled the same as my blog title: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123958260423012269.html">Everyone Should Pay Income Taxes</a>. Although, I am not totally in favor of some of his political ideas, the premise is sound.</p>

<p>I am a proponent of a flat tax system, or tier max tax system. Let me explain…</p>

<p>In a simple flat tax system, everyone pays the same amount, or percentage, for example 10% of their income. This is simple to determine and pay. If we exclude tax credits, or deductions, it is generally considered fair. Those who oppose the system say its not fair that they must pay if they make more. I contend the person who makes $10,000.00 is more affected than the person making a million.</p>

<p>The other system may be more palpable to some. It requires that everyone pay a percentage of their income up to a maximum amount. For example, we all pay 10% up to a maximum of (for the sake of discussion) a tax bill of one million. Anything above ten million in income is not taxed.</p>

<p>These numbers would need to be adjusted to compensate for our budget requirements.</p>

<p>In Mr. Fleischer’s article he mentions abolishing estate taxes. I agree. Why punish families for growing wealth over generations. This is what America is all about.</p>

<p>He concludes his article with a wonderful quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Its funny what happens when everyone pays the bills; Americans may want less spending so they can pay fewer bills.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps this will force some fiscal responsibility to reduce our $2 trillion dollar budget deficits.</p>

	     <h1 id="do-achievable-things">Do Achievable Things!</h1>

<p>Every year most people make resolutions to do things like lose weight, eat more at home, travel, etc. After
some period of time most of those resolutions follow the way of the dinosaur. This year my New Year’s resolution
is to <strong>Do Achievable Things</strong>. This phrase is meant to act as a reminder to make decisions to do things that you can feel
a sense of success. Pick small tasks like walk daily, or run a mile. These small acts add up over time and builds upon success after success.</p>

<p>This last year I lost 30 lbs. I was running everyday, and switched over to a training plan to run a half-marathon this month. Unfortunately, I got a really bad
cold with bronchitis which totally derailed my running and training. The goal was reachable, but forces outside my control are going to make this goal unreachable
this month. Once I am back to being healthy, I will achieve this goal.</p>

<p>One of the goals I have is to migrate my blog from Wordpress over to Github, and to write more frequently. Let’s see how that works out by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>Happy New Year 2020.</p>

	     <h3 id="independence-day">Independence Day…</h3>

<p>I think most Americans will celebrate with food, fireworks, and perhaps some beverages (adult or otherwise. The historical context is lost to many.</p>

<p>Beer and barbecues have made this a classic for summer. Most families plan holidays around this date and it has become one less day of vacation charged against them for the year.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a little story of Dave and Goliath. On July 2nd, 1776, a group of what we would later call “Patriots” decided to declare independence from Great Britain. Two days later, the rebellion was on. The delegates from the 13 colonies signed the Declaration of Independence. Thirteen colonies against “The Empire”; like I said David vs. Goliath.</p>

<p>Fortunately for a number of events at the time, and the distance of the colonies from Britain, our fledgling rebellion had a chance. Today we know that was more than a mere chance, but to our Founding Fathers it was as likely to fail as succeed. Failure they understood would have them hanging from trees and gallows across the colonies. It meant that their families would be punished, and their fortunes ruined. This was a huge risk.</p>

<h3 id="the-birth-of-a-nation">The Birth of a Nation</h3>

<p>Fortunately, our Founding Fathers had a number of things going for them that made them more than just rebellious traitors. They were on the whole very bright, well educated, thoughtful, introspective, and surprisingly forward thinking. These men, who form a well known circle in American thinking, were Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin. Thomas Jefferson being the primary author of the Declaration of Independence is considered with a special regards.</p>

<p>The preceding conflicts in 1775 and subsequent American Revolution made The Declaration of Independence more than just ink on paper; it cost real lives. It was really America’s first civil war. Remember we were all citizens of the crown. There were friends and family on both sides of this conflict just as in the later Civil War.</p>

<p>Success and luck on the battlefield with the assistance of the French turned the paper tiger of ink to the reality we have today.</p>

<p>Let me ask you a question for your own reflection. Would you be willing to sacrifice your life, and more importantly that of your families for an idea? An untested, and unproven idea to say the least.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-patriotic">What does it mean to be patriotic?</h3>

<p>It means believing in the rule of law. It means that if you don’t like the laws: change them. There is a place for civil disobedience, but in the context of a legal framework.</p>

<p>It means exercising your right to vote. If you don’t vote, you have disenfranchised yourself. You can complain about your politicians, it is your right to do so. However if you didn’t vote, you are responsible for your own fate.</p>

<p>It means challenging your government. We have become complacent in accepting double speak from our elected officials. Why do politicians need spokespeople? Shouldn’t they be able to tell you what they think? You should hold them suspect for having public relations and spokespeople. It means they are interested in public perception and not public action.</p>

<p>We honor our soldiers and sailors. We should. However, uniformed members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should be deserving of our respect as well. They are trying to do their jobs in a volatile and heated political environment. The majority of them, like members of our uniformed services, are good and decent people with very difficult jobs. Don’t deride a person’s job if you wouldn’t be willing to do it yourself. <strong>Think garbage man</strong>.</p>

<p>It means standing for our flag even if you are angry with your government. It is a symbol of <strong>YOUR</strong> freedom and an ideal that many people before and after you will make the ultimate sacrifice to ensure.</p>

<p>It is <strong>OUR</strong> Constitution that gives you rights. Consider it on the basis of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, and keep it close to your buxom. Read it yourself.</p>

<p>I am sure many of you can offer your own suggestions of what it means to be patriotic.</p>

<h3 id="historical-interest">Historical Interest</h3>

<ul>
  <li>John Adams told his wife Abigail that July 2nd would be celebrated as the day of independence. He refused to accept the 4th as the date, and would not celebrate it.</li>
  <li>Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died on July 4th 1826. Fifty years to the date of the signing of The Declaration of Independence.</li>
  <li>The first celebrations were mock funerals of King George III.</li>
  <li>It became a Federal Holiday in 1870. Seventy-One years later, it became a paid holiday for Federal employees in 1941. This was just before our entrance into another war in which we were Allies with our former colonial rulers.</li>
  <li>At the end of the American Revolution, there were two primary political parties: Federalist and humorously today: Democratic-Republicans. We could only hope for such a middle of the isle centrist ruling coalition today.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>On the 4th, when you are enjoying your overcooked hotdog, hoist up your sun burned hand, and toast a cold beer to these brave citizens that gave you the freedom you have today.</p>

	  <title>Legos without Plastics?</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I see that Lego is trying to develop a new material replacement for the iconic ABS plastic blocks it uses in its products. They used 77,000 metric tonnes of petroleum based ABS plastic to manufacture 60 million bricks in 2014. Apparently the challenge is to use a replacement material that will have the same color and characteristics as existing bricks. This will be no small challenge. I applaud their efforts, and I hope they are successful.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure if that is as important as reducing the reliance on ABS plastic. Fruity Pebbles went all natural and removed the artificial colors. Yes, the colors are more natural and muted, but I like them better than radioactive yellow and magenta and biohazard red anyway. Perhaps they can make some corn stalk all natural blocks and test the market waters. I imagine today they would be well received.</p>

We’re back, We’re back We’re back from under the sea.<br />
We’re back, We’re back<br />
Yes, We’re back from under the sea.</p>

  <p>We’ve sailed ‘til we’ve reached all our sessions<br />
We’ve landed with no body hurt.<br />
We went to our Blue and Gold banquet.<br />
Should have been in a Blue, Gold grass skirt.</p>

We’re heading back home this fine evening<br />
After having fun all of the day.<br />
The last thing the staff will hear<br />
Is “<strong>THANKS FOR A GREAT POW WOW DAY</strong>”. <br />

<p>Last weekend I built the <a href="http://www.midwestproducts.com/">Midwest Products</a> Japanese Zero model. It took a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon to make. It is a nice balsa and tissue paper model powered by a rubber-band. The model was fun to build and fly.</p>

<p>If you like model airplanes, look for this classic on Ebay. It is kit #425.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to build this really easy to assemble Whitewings Tri-Linear 900L Lindberg model airplane. It is a thick paper airplane. It flies like a dream. You can either fly it via hand toss, or use a sling shot. If you are looking for an airplane to build in the morning, and fly all afternoon, this is it.</p>

<p>The other day my wife made pulled pork. She cooked it in a slow cooker all day.</p>

<p>When I went to cut it up and pull it apart, I did it mostly by hand. It truly was hand pulled pork. It simply melted in your mouth it was so tender.</p>

<p><strong>Delicious!</strong></p>

<p>In my last post on <a href="/2011-07-10-moonshine-jelly.html">Moonshine Jelly</a>. I mentioned a neat general store where you can get some unusual food. While I was there, I purchased some Kudzu Blossom Jelly.</p>

<p>For those of you who may not know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu">Kudzu</a> is a vine which is native to Japan. It was introduced in the Southern United States in a variety of ways. The largest introduction was from the Soil Conservation Service. It is now considered a week, and responsible for enormous habitat destruction in the Southeastern United States.</p>

<p>Kudzu Blossom Jelly seems to be at least some practical use for it. This jelly is a surprisingly sweet jelly with a nice “wild” taste. I would recommend eating as much as you like and help save the South.</p>

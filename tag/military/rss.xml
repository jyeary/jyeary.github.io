	     <p>The controversial Boeing KC-46 Refueling Tanker has finally cleared the Pentagon’s testing and contract awarding process on the 15th of August 2016. The U.S. Air Force will issue the initial contract within the next 30 days to begin the construction of 19 KC-46 aircraft.</p>

<p>These next generation aerial refueling aircraft will begin to replace the aging KC-135 tankers in the current military inventory. The airframe is based on the Boeing 767 which should allow production synergies to be maximized for the construction of the aircraft.</p>

<p>The first aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in August 2017.
Apparently, the deliveries can’t come fast enough: <a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/articles/refueling-issues-cause-military-jets-to-change-route">Refueling issues cause military jets to change route</a>. That was the headline I heard this morning while contemplating this blog post.</p>

	  <title>Joint Tactical Light Vehicle (JTLV)</title>

	     <p>The DoD awarded the the initial production run of the JTLV to <a href="http://oshkoshdefense1-px.rtrk.com">OshKosh Defense</a>. It seems to have produced a number of interesting remarks from outsiders who think OshKosh B’Gosh childrens clothing.</p>

<p>This is a fine weapon and delivery system and not a child’s toy. The image to the right I found using a Google search. I found it funny because of the tag on the front that says “No Photography”. The vehicle looks very nice, and hopefully will perform as expected.</p>

<p>The vehicle for me seems to have one visible flaw. The large undefended radiator grill in the front. I think that this needs to be covered more effectively, or moved to the top of the hood as much as possible.</p>

<p>The initial cost per unit is roughly $300K which is more than a HUMMV, but considerably lower than MRAP.</p>

<p>My expectation is that this vehicle helps protect our troops and bring them home safely at the end of the day. The price tag is not the defining issue here.</p>

	  <title>Chinese Navy in US Territorial Waters</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday and today that Chinese naval vessels were found in US territorial waters off of Alaska. Does this indicate a shift in Chinese military stance? I believe it is significant in its timing as noted in the articles.1, 2</p>

<p>There are five principle timing events to keep in mind: President Obama was visiting Alaska, the Chinese military was celebrating 70 years since the end of WWII  with an enormous parade (which coincidentally included Vladimir Putin as a guest), US military pivot to the Pacific, and US Naval challenge of the “freedom of the seas” in the Spratly Islands, and Chinese cyberwarfare against US government agencies and military.</p>

<p>The first seems to be a passive-aggressive issue where the Chinese are putting ships in an area where a US president is visiting. It is a technique we use to project force worldwide. Our typical stance is to send a carrier group to an area as a show of force. This seems on the surface to be the same thing. It is worth noting that while President Obama and Vladimir Putin were exchanging a phone conversation in July to celebrate Independence Day, the Russians sent bombers to Alaska and California. In both cases, I think we are expected to see the force projection.3</p>

<p>The Chinese sent invitations for the US to attend the 70th Anniversary of end of WWII celebrations which included an outlandish military parade 4, 5 reminiscent of Soviet military parades during the Cold War. The parade included the current militaristic dictator of Russia who I may conjecture knew of the Chinese vessels in Alaskan waters. Since previous to this event, they were engaged in military exercises with the Russians.</p>

<p>The US military pivot to the Pacific is old news, but it is significant in the Chinese eyes that they see the US as a threat to their agenda. One in which old adversaries of the US (Russia/China) play a strategic partnership to advance a thinly veiled expansion agenda.</p>

<p>The Chinese have been advancing their agenda in the South China Sea with the construction of artificial islands much to the chagrin of their neighbors. These islands include one which has a military air strip and radar installations. They have also threatened the US Navy with violations of their territorial waters, though in the case of the Spratly Islands in question, international law says otherwise. The tit-for-tat approach of the Chinese Navy in undisputed US territorial waters is a taunt to say “What is the US going to do about it?” The US military says that they are free to operate with the “freedom of the seas” carefully tossed back in our faces.</p>

<p>All of this occurs with the backdrop of the Chinese military spying on the US government and engaging in Cyber warfare. The Obama administration has emasculated the military and engaged in military bravado speeches about a pivot, and “freedom of the seas”.  The US Navy is in such a declined state, we can’t effectively project force, and we must “pivot”. Once upon a time, the US had a 600 ship navy second to none. Today, that navy is reduced to 236 commissioned ships and 417 if you count non-commissioned (USNS) and Ready Reserve Fleet. The 236 includes non-combatant vessels.6</p>

<p>If the US wants to continue to be a dominant military, this must change. The Russians and Chinese have figured out we are starting to soften, and are pushing in on the edges toward the center.</p>

<p>The only pivot I see here is at the waist of the military leaders who may also know it as <strong>BOHICA</strong>.</p>

	  <title>Military Lending Act Regulation Expansion</title>

	     <p>I wanted to take a moment to thank the Obama Administration for their rule changes with regards to the Military Lending Act of 2006. The new regulations make it harder for lenders (let’s call them poachers) from charging outrageously high interest rates to our men and women who serve this country.</p>

<p>I still believe that Congress and this administration need to take a further step. The changes limit the cap on interest rates to 36%. This is still usury in its worst form. The Congress and administration should consider the cap at 20% for all citizens, but I would be happy if this considered this for military service members.</p>

	  <title>Linda Norgrove's Tragic Death</title>

<p>Let me start by extending my deepest condolences to Ms Norgrove’s family. The work your daughter was doing to help the lives of those less fortunate is commendable. On behalf of all those who support those who help others, this loss is even more tragic.</p>

<p>I support an inquiry into the events of Ms. Norgrove’s death, but I am disheartened that their seems to be a bunch of finger pointing at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces_%28United_States_Army%29">American Special Forces</a> team that were attempting her rescue. The fact that Linda was kidnapped and being held against her will seems to be lost here. Also the fact that the commanders on the ground believed her to be in imminent danger seems to be overlooked.</p>

<p>I know that if I were Linda, I would have liked for someone to rescue me. I am sure she would understand that there was no malice, and that the brave team that went in to rescue her at their peril were trying to do the right thing.</p>

<p>I want to take a moment to say thank you to the troops who risked their lives to save her, and take with them a lessons learned. Hold your heads up high and don’t let this tragedy distract you from your mission.</p>

<p>Today, tomorrow, or next week you may be asked to go into harms way again to attempt a rescue of someone else, and that needs to be your focus.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">First World
War</a>, “The war
to end all wars”, ended for most of us in 1919 at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles">Treaty of
Versailles</a>.
After 92 years, it will end on Sunday. I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history">military
history</a>,
but this one eluded me. The article in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8029948/First-World-War-officially-ends.html">Telegraph:First World War
officially
ends</a>,
has more details, and it is an amazing story. Congratulations to Germany
for repaying their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_reparations">war reparations</a>.
I appreciate their tenacity, and sense of responsibility. There are a
number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies">Allies</a> which
borrowed extensively from the U.S. during both wars that still have yet
to pay their debts back. Germany which had many reasons not to do it has
“done the right thing”.  Unfortunately this lesson in responsibility
will be lost on most Americans, especially the current generation.</p>

<p>Congrats Germany (Deutschland) on doing the right thing, and let us all
put the “War to end all wars” behind us, and look forward to the future.</p>
